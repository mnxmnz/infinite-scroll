### Mock API Configuration

The application uses MSW (Mock Service Worker) to mock API endpoints.
You can control the Mock API behavior using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK` environment variable.

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK=true` to enable Mock API
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK=false` or leave it unset to disable Mock API

The Mock API is enabled by default in the development environment through `.env.development`.
